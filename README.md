Below is a **README.md** file that provides clear and easy-to-follow instructions for setting up and running the chess game using a **virtual desktop environment**. This guide assumes you're using a cloud VM with a graphical interface (e.g., Google Cloud VM with XFCE desktop).

# Chess Game - README

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the chess game on a **virtual desktop environment**. The game is built using Python and Pygame, and it includes features like piece movement, capturing, turn-based play, check detection, checkmate detection, and castling.

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. A **cloud VM** with a graphical desktop environment (e.g., XFCE).
2. **Python 3** installed on the VM.
3. **Pygame** installed on the VM.
4. Chess piece images (PNG files) in the same directory as the script.

---

## **Step 1: Set Up the Virtual Desktop**
1. **Create a Cloud VM:**
   - Use a cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure) to create a VM with a graphical desktop environment (e.g., XFCE).
   - Ensure the VM has **SSH access** and a **public IP address**.

2. **Install a Desktop Environment:**
   - If not already installed, set up a desktop environment (e.g., XFCE) on the VM:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies
     ```

3. **Install a Remote Desktop Server:**
   - Install `xrdp` to enable remote desktop access:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install xrdp
     sudo systemctl enable xrdp
     sudo systemctl start xrdp
     ```

4. **Open Port 3389:**
   - Allow remote desktop connections by opening port 3389 in the VM's firewall:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
     ```

5. **Connect to the VM:**
   - Use a remote desktop client (e.g., Microsoft Remote Desktop, Remmina) to connect to the VM using its public IP address.
   - Log in with your VM credentials.

---

## **Step 2: Install Python and Pygame**
1. **Install Python 3:**
   - Open a terminal in the desktop environment and run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3
     ```

2. **Install Pygame:**
   - Install Pygame using pip:
     ```bash
     pip3 install pygame
     ```

---

## **Step 3: Download the Chess Game Code**
1. **Download the Code:**
   - Open a terminal in the desktop environment.
   - Create a directory for the chess game:
     ```bash
     mkdir chess_game
     cd chess_game
     ```
   - Download the `chess_game.py` script and chess piece images (e.g., `white_pawn.png`, `black_rook.png`, etc.) into this directory.

2. **Verify the Files:**
   - Ensure the following files are in the `chess_game` directory:
     - `chess_game.py`
     - Chess piece images (12 PNG files, e.g., `white_pawn.png`, `black_rook.png`, etc.).

---

## **Step 4: Run the Chess Game**
1. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Open a terminal in the desktop environment and navigate to the `chess_game` directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~/chess_game
     ```

2. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute the Python script:
     ```bash
     python3 chess_game.py
     ```

3. **Play the Game:**
   - Use your mouse to select and move pieces.
   - Follow the rules of chess:
     - Pawns move forward and capture diagonally.
     - Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
     - Knights move in an "L" shape.
     - Bishops move diagonally.
     - Queens combine the moves of rooks and bishops.
     - Kings move one square in any direction.
     - Castling is allowed under the standard rules.

---

## **Step 5: Troubleshooting**
1. **Missing Images:**
   - If the chess pieces don't appear, ensure the image files are in the same directory as `chess_game.py` and named correctly (e.g., `white_pawn.png`, `black_rook.png`).

2. **Pygame Not Installed:**
   - If you see an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'`, install Pygame:
     ```bash
     pip3 install pygame
     ```

3. **Remote Desktop Issues:**
   - If you can't connect to the VM, ensure port 3389 is open and `xrdp` is running:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status xrdp
     ```

---

## **Step 6: Enhancements (Optional)**
Here are some optional features you can add to the game:
1. **Sound Effects:** Add sounds for moves and captures using `pygame.mixer`.
2. **Timer:** Implement a chess clock to limit player turn times.
3. **GUI Improvements:** Add a menu for starting a new game or quitting.
